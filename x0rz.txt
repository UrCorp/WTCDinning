"""It was once upon a time, Charles Hourtoule, a wannabe French citizen who in fact, had no link to France and was from Quebec, but what's funny there, is the fact he keeps pretending he is French. No guys, stop BS. He is Canadian, (Montreal) and that's why he speaks French..."""

He looks like a geek, but then why does he allow himself to judge people that he actually does not know, pretending he is a reference in the infosec world ? Aren't geeks supposed to respect each other ? lmfao, he's nothing of the above, he's just a great speaker, that's because of people like him, that we complain beginners succes in the infosec depends on sociability & not skill.

#How dumb is he ? Proof 1 over a Screenshot:
"""
Screen : https://prnt.sc/lyvrtt
Databreaches involving the theft of million of passwords and containing million of entries, were almost all exposed during the spring of 2016, it includes:
-Linkedin
-MySpace
-Weebly
-DailyMotion
-Vk
[among others]
Since then, most people are aware reusing password can be dangerous, before 2016 password re-use attacks were the most common attack vector, etc etc.
So wtf, try on facebook hourto_c@epita.fr, password 147258sdf and you'll see our half-ass researcher waited until the end of 2017 to change his facebook password, hahahahahahah.

##Conclusion
##Game over kid, and please for once, tell the truth to your blind followers: you were not born in Paris, but in Montreal, QC.

Charles, tu ne sais rien faire. Et t'oses parler de désinformation, mais tout ce que tu fais c'est parler et péter plus haut que ton cul, tu n'as aucune opsec, aucune connaissance.
T'es stupide, toxique, tu reflètes très bien la comme infosec de nos jours.
Il n'y aura aucun takedown, toutes les images ont été téléchargées. Arrête de donner des leçons sur le recyclage des mot de passes, t'es mal placé pour parler grosse merde.
